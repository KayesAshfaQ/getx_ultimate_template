## Git Commit Message Conventions

When committing changes, we follow certain conventions to make our commit messages more readable and useful. Here are the types of commits we use:

- `feat`: A new feature is introduced with the changes.
- `fix`: A bug fix has occurred.
- `chore`: Changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies).
- `refactor`: Refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- `docs`: Updates to documentation such as the README or other markdown files.
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.
- `test`: Including new or correcting previous tests.
- `perf`: Performance improvements.
- `ci`: Continuous integration related.
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit.

By following these conventions, we can maintain a clean and understandable commit history.
